Privacy Policy for NoSave Chat

Effective Date: January 6, 2026

NoSave Chat (“we”, “our”, “the app”) allows users to send messages via WhatsApp, WhatsApp Business, and Telegram without saving contacts. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user information.

1. Information We Collect

NoSave Chat does not store your messages or contacts.

We do not collect personal chat content, phone numbers, or contact lists.

We may collect minimal analytics (crash reports, usage statistics) via Google Mobile Ads or Flutter tools to improve the app. These analytics are anonymous and cannot identify you.

2. Ads

The app uses Google AdMob for banner and rewarded ads.

Ad requests may involve device identifiers or anonymized information used by AdMob.

This data is handled by Google, not stored by NoSave Chat.

3. Data Usage

Collected data is used only to:

Show relevant ads

Improve app stability and performance

Understand app usage patterns

We do not sell, share, or distribute any personal information to third parties.

4. Security

We implement standard security measures to protect analytics and app data. Since the app does not store messages, no chat content is at risk.

5. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy when needed. Changes will be reflected in app updates. Users should check this page periodically.
